# LSL Recording

This a convenient wrapper, bridging to control the LSL recorder via a Dareplane API server.
If you use this module, right now you manually need to start the [`LSL LabRecorder`](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder) before spawning the module. This is a limitation of the current implementation.

Starting up the LabRecorder will be automated in the future.
